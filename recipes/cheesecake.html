    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 320°F (160°C).</p></li>
        <li><p>In a small pot over medium heat, whisk together the butter, cream cheese, and milk until melted and smooth. Remove from the heat</p>
            <p>let cool.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth, then slowly drizzle in the cream cheese mixture, stirring until evenly combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sift in the flour and the cornstarch, whisking to make sure there are no lumps.</p></li>    
        <li><p>In another large bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar while continuing to </p>
            <p>beat until stiff peaks form.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fold about ¼ of the egg whites and into the yolk mixture, then repeat with the remaining egg whites until the batter is evenly</p>
            <p>combined.</p></li>    
        <li><p>Grease the bottom of a 9 x 3-inch (23 x 7.5 cm) round cake pan, then line the bottom and sides with parchment paper. If using </p>
            <p>a springform pan, make sure to wrap the bottom and sides completely in foil twice to prevent any leakage.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Pour the batter into the pan and shake to release any large air bubbles.</p></li>  
        <li><p>Place the pan into a larger baking dish lined with 2 paper towels at the bottom. The paper towels ensure that the heat is </p>
            <p>distributed evenly along the bottom of the pan. Fill the larger pan about 1-inch (2-cm) high with hot water.</p></li>    
        <li><p>Bake for 25 minutes, then reduce the heat to 285°F (140°C), and bake for another 55 minutes, until the cake has risen to almost </p>
            <p>double its original height.</p></li>    
        <li><p>Remove from oven, and carefully invert the cake onto your dominant hand and peel off the paper. Be extremely careful, the cake </p>
            <p>will be hot. You can also invert the cake onto a plate, but this will cause the cake to deflate more.</p></li>    
        <li><p>Dust the top of the cake with powdered sugar, then slice and serve with strawberries while still warm!</p></li>    
        <li>Enjoy!</li>

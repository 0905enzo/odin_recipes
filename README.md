# odin_recipes
In this project, I will be working on a basic recipes page.
Using all the knowledge i get from the basic HTML lessons from The Odin Project, i will deliver a consistent proof of my adquired abilities.
Including headers, images, paragraphs, links and, most important, ordered and unordered lists.
I will make an special effort to understand the practical implements of good commit messages.
Days later, I add stylesheets for everything, as I finish the CSS basic lessons. I now understand better how and when to commit.
